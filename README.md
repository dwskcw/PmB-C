# Puckman Ball
Originally written in Java as part of HackRPI 2024, the original code can be found **[here](https://github.com/dwskcw/PuckmanBall)**. I made the assumption Java would be easier for my teammates to set up and get running, and had previous experience with the Raylib binding.

With this port our goal is to clean up the code and implement new features (goal animation, rounded corner collision, and sound effects).


## Building and running

VSCode users should be able to open this repo and press F5 to build the project, assuming you have the C extension and everything set up; output will be in the bin directory.

Otherwise refer to the [template instructions](https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart/blob/main/README.md)
